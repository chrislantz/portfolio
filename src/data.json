                "I am a web developer with over 5 years experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript. For the past 4 years I have worked as a developer at Readz, a web publishing platform for designing and editing websites. While working at Readz I've done both front and back-end development on a stack comprised of Python/Django, MySQL, jQuery and a custom javascript templating system. In 2012 I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Information Technology from California State Monterey Bay.",
                "I have worked with a number of front-end, back-end and database systems. I have experience working with MySQL databases using raw SQL as well as ORMs. Additionally, I have experience with NoSQL databases (Amazon DynamoDB, Redis). I have worked on web applications in several back-end languages such as Perl, PHP and most recently Python/Django. I have 5 years experience working with javascript, jQuery and am currently learning React.",
                "I am familiar with configuring and administering common web services such as Apache, Nginx and MySQL. I have experience building virtual servers using Xen, in addition to being familiar with other virtualization technologies such as VMware and VirtualBox."
